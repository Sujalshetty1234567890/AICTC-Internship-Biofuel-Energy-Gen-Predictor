# WEEK-1-EDUNET
Week 1 Project- Sustainable Energy and Effieciency


Welcome to the Efficient Biofuel Energy Generation prediction project, the python notebook guides you through data exploration, visualization and data splitting to predict the generation of efficient biofuel energy through natural lifestock and reducing CO2 and increasing efficiency


Problem Statement 

Prediciting Efficient Biofuel Energy Generation using livestock in a plant and comparing the CO2 Emission with fossil fuels to findout the sustainability and harm compared to other traditional fossil fuels and it's other advantages(Biofuels).

MODEL USED


LINEAR REGRESSION WITH LINEAR REGRESSION CHART


by putting the data through various algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, KMean, etc, it best works out with Linear regression model with much more accuracy

but we will be working on the model even more even after completion to bring it to the best output and make the model accuacy the best ever
