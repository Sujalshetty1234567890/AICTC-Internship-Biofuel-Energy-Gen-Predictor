# WEEK-1-EDUNET
Week 1 Project- Sustainable Energy and Effieciency


Welcome to the Efficient Biofuel Energy Generation prediction project, the python notebook guides you through data exploration, visualization and data splitting to predict the generation of efficient biofuel energy through natural lifestock and reducing CO2 and increasing efficiency


Problem Statement 

Prediciting Efficient Biofuel Energy Generation using livestock in a plant and comparing the CO2 Emission with fossil fuels to findout the sustainability and harm compared to other traditional fossil fuels and it's other advantages(Biofuels).
